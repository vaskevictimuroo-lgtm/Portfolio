Self-Check Application
A machine learning application for self-assessment and analysis with neural network implementation.

Project Structure
Self-check/

main.py - Main application entry point

trained_weights.npz - Pre-trained neural network weights

README.md - Project documentation

Features
Neural Network Implementation - Custom ML model for analysis tasks

Pre-trained Model - Ready-to-use trained weights for immediate inference

Self-assessment Capabilities - Designed for evaluation and checking tasks

Technologies Used
Python 3.x

NumPy (for .npz weight files)

Machine Learning/Neural Networks

Installation
Clone the repository:

text
git clone https://github.com/vaskevictimuroo-lgtm/Portfolio
cd Portfolio/Self-check
Install required dependencies:

text
pip install numpy
Run the application:

text
python main.py
Usage
The application uses pre-trained neural network weights for inference. The trained_weights.npz file contains the model parameters that are loaded by the main application.

File Descriptions
main.py - Main script that loads the trained model and performs inference

trained_weights.npz - Serialized NumPy array containing the trained neural network weights and biases

Model Details
The neural network implementation includes forward propagation and inference capabilities. The model architecture is optimized for classification and analysis tasks relevant to self-assessment applications.
